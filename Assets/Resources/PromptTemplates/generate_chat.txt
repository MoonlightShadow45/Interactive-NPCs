# generate_chat.txt  
# params: agent, iss, statements, target, chat_history, sequence

Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:  
{{ iss }}

{{ agent }} is talking with {{ target }}.  
Their current chat history is:  
{{ chat_history }}

Here are thoughts and memories in {{ agent }}â€™s mind:  
{{ statements }}

You are role-playing as {{ agent }}.  
Now is the {{ sequence }} time {{ agent }} speaks (out of at most 5 total turns).  
What does {{ agent }} say to {{ target }} next?

Respond in **exactly** this JSON format:
{
  "message": "The message content",
  "end": false
}

- "message" can be an empty string if {{ agent }} chooses to remain silent this turn.
- Set "end" to true only if {{ agent }} thinks the conversation should be over after the current "message".
- The 5-turn limit is handled externally and does not affect "end".
- Output only the JSON, without any Markdown formatting or code block markers. No extra text.
