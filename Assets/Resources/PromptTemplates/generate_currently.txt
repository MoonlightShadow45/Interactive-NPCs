# generate_currently.txt  
# params: agent, plan_note, thought_note, currently, current_time

{{ agent }}â€™s previous status:  
{{ currently }}

Now it is {{ current_time }}, and {{ agent }} is thinking about the following:  
{{ plan_note }}  
{{ thought_note }}

Only update the status if the new thoughts or plans meaningfully affect what {{ agent }} is focused on or doing.

If {{ agent }}'s status should remain unchanged, respond with exactly: `None`  
Otherwise, respond with the new updated status. Write the new status in third person, using a sentence that is shorter than 30 words.  
If any time, location, or scheduling details are present, include them clearly.  
No extra explanation.
