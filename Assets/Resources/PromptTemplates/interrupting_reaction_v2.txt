# interrupting_reaction_v2.txt
# params: agent, iss, events, current_action

Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:
{{ iss }}

{{ agent }} is currently engaged in: {{ current_action }}

{{ agent }} has perceived and recalled the following things:
{{ events }}

If {{ agent }} would like to interrupt the current activity and respond to any of these events, return a new action for {{ agent }} to take.
The action must follow this json format:
{
  "DurationInMinutes": int,
  "Activity": string
}

Notes: 
- The `Activity` must be a verb phrase in -ing form that fits into the sentence: "{{ agent }} is {Activity}".
- DurationInMinutes must be a multiple of 10  
- Return the result as a strict **JSON object**, with no Markdown formatting, code blocks, or extra text
- If `Activity` is related to another character, it must include one of the following verbs: "attack", "talk", "give"(when {{ agent }} would like to give an item to someone), "follow" or "run away from".

If {{ agent }} doesn't want to respond to any of the events, return exactly: `none`

Respond with **only** the JSON (if reacting), or `none`. No explanation or extra content.
