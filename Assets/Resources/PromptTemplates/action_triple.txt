# action_triple.txt  
# params: agent, action

Extract the semantic triple from the following sentence.  
Output exactly **three** components, in the format:  
subject || predicate || object

- The triple should capture the core meaning of the sentence.  
- You may interpret each part broadly (e.g., include context or modifiers if relevant).  
- If the object cannot be clearly found or inferred, use `none`.  
- Do not add extra text or explanation. Respond with only the triple, separated by "||".

Input: {{ agent }} is {{ action }}
