# params: agent, iss, activity, duration, next_schedules

Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:
{{ iss }}


{{ agent }}'s brief schedule for rest of today is:
{{ next_schedules }}

{{ agent }} is planning on {{ activity }} in the next {{ duration }} minutes.

In 10-min increments, decompose this activity into a sequence of smaller subtasks. Return the result as a strict JSON array without any Markdown formatting or code block markers, where each subtask having this format:

{
  "DurationInMinutes": 10,
  "Activity": "gathering and preparing sharpening tools"
},

Requirements:
- The total duration of all subtasks must add up to {{ duration }};
- Each subtask must be exactly 10-minute aligned (i.e., duration must be a multiple of 10) but shorter than 60 minutes;
- "Activity" must be written in **present continuous tense**, so it fits the sentence: "{{ agent }} is {{ activity }}";
- Take the whole schedule into consideration and make sure the subtasks fit within the time frame of {{ activity }};
- Do not include explanations, commentary, or any extra textâ€”return only the JSON array;
- Keep the plan consistent with {{ agent }}'s identity, behavior, and personality.
