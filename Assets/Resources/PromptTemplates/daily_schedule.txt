# daily_schedule.txt
# params: agent, iss, wakeup_hour, daily_plan

Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:
{{ iss }}


{{ agent }}'s plan for today includes the following key activities with suggested times:
{{ daily_plan }}

Respond with a list of more detailed hourly-scheduled activities starting from hour {{ wakeup_hour }} up to hour 23. The output must be a JSON object with the following format:

{
  "plan": [
    { "hour": int, "activity": string }
  ]
}

Requirements:
- Only include a single entry per new activity, starting from its starting hour;
- Do not repeat an activity over consecutive hours if it continues — assume it fills the time until the next activity;
- "activity" must be in present continuous tense, so it can complete the sentence: "{{ agent }} is {{ activity }}";
- Ensure that all key activities are placed near their intended hour;
- Fill in reasonable filler activities when needed;
- Keep the plan consistent with {{ agent }}'s identity, behavior, and personality.
- Return only the JSON object, without any Markdown formatting or code block markers — no explanations or extra text.
