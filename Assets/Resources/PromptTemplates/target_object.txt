Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:  
{{ iss }}

{{ objects }}

Choose the object that is most suitable for the action, based on the descriptions.

Respond with the name of the selected object and a second value (true or false), separated by a comma.

- The second value must be `true` **only** if the selected object is `"relic"` and {{ agent }} intends to loot it.  
- For **all other objects**, the second value must be `false` â€” even if they are suitable for the action.

If none of the objects are suitable, respond with: `none,false`
