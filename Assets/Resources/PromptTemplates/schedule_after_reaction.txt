Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:
{{ iss }}

Here is {{ agent }}'s current schedule for the rest of today (presented in human-readable format):
{{ next_schedules }}

The total duration of this schedule must remain the same after any modifications.  

{{ agent }} has perceived and recalled the following things:
{{ events }}

If {{ agent }} would like to interrupt the current schedule and respond to any of these events, revise the schedule accordingly: 
- Insert appropriate subtasks for the response
- Adjust or remove existing subtasks as needed  
- Ensure the **total duration remains the same** as the original schedule  
- Return the result as a strict JSON array without any Markdown formatting or code block markers
- The updated schedule must follow this format for each item:

{
  "DurationInMinutes": 10,
  "Activity": "checking whether the guard has heard the strange noise"
}

If {{ agent }} doesn't want to respond to any of the events, return exactly: `none`

Respond with **only** the JSON array (if reacting), or `none`. No explanation or extra content.
