# schedule_after_reaction.txt  
# params: agent, iss, next_schedules, old_currently

Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:  
{{ iss }}

{{ agent }}'s previous "currently" status was:  
{{ old_currently }}

Here is {{ agent }}'s previous schedule for the rest of the day (in human-readable format):  
{{ next_schedules }}

The total duration of the schedule must remain exactly the same after any changes.

If {{ agent }} wants to revise their schedule due to their updated state:  
- Insert appropriate new activities that reflect the change in status  
- Modify or remove existing activities as needed  
- Ensure the **total duration remains unchanged**
- Return the result as a strict JSON array without any Markdown formatting or code block markers
- Use this format for each activity:

{
  "DurationInMinutes": 10,
  "Activity": "checking whether the guard has heard the strange noise"
}

If {{ agent }} chooses to keep their schedule unchanged, respond with: `none`  
Respond with **only** the JSON array (if changed), or `none`. No explanation.
