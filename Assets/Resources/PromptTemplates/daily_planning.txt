# params: agent, iss, wakeup_time

Here is a brief description of {{ agent }}:
{{ iss }}

Today {{ agent }} is planning to wake up at {{ wakeup_time }}. Respond with {{ agent }}'s plan for the rest of the day in JSON format. The format should be:

{
  "plan": [
    { "hour": int, "activity": string }
  ]
}

Requirements:
- Only return a valid JSON object, without any Markdown formatting or code block markers;
- Each entry must include an integer 'hour' (0â€“23) and a string 'activity';
- {{ agent }} must be asleep between 23 and 3;
- One activity can last more than one hour, and it's fine to have gaps between activities;
- Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler tasks just to fill time and only include hours when meaningful activities start;
- Activities should reflect {{ agent }}'s identity, lifestyle, and mood for the day.
